# Weather_Report
# 🌦️ Weather Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing weather data to uncover patterns and trends related to temperature, humidity, and other atmospheric conditions. It uses real-world weather data collected over time and provides insights using Python libraries like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**.

---

## 📌 Project Goals

- Clean and preprocess the weather dataset
- Perform statistical analysis on weather attributes
- Generate visualizations to explore trends and relationships
- Save findings and summary into a downloadable CSV

---

## 📁 Files in This Repo

- `Weather_Analysis.csv` – Final analyzed dataset (exported from the notebook)
- `Weather_Analysis.ipynb` – The Colab notebook containing the full code and visualizations *(upload this too if not already)*
- `README.md` – You're reading it 😉

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – data handling & cleaning
- **NumPy** – numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** – data visualization
- **Seaborn** *(optional)* – advanced plots
- **Google Colab** – for coding and exporting

---

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed

- Handling missing values and data types
- Grouping by date and calculating averages
- Correlation analysis and heatmap visualization
- Line plots to visualize temperature, humidity, etc.
